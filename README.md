# Water-quality-prediction-
Water quality prediction 

This project uses Python and machine learning to predict whether water is safe or unsafe based on various features like pH, turbidity, conductivity, and more.

What It Does:
Analyzes water quality data

Cleans and prepares the dataset

Uses machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Predicts if water is safe or not safe for consumption

Tools & Technologies:
Python

Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for building ML models)


 Goal:
To help monitor and predict water quality using data-driven methods, making water safety analysis faster and more accessible.
